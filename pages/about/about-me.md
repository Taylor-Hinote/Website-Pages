I am a software developer and a sailor living in sunny Florida with my two cats, Shimmer and George. I have been developing since I was 15 and started sailing when I was 10.

My programming journey began with HoTMetaLPro6, introduced to me by my mentor, who was older and more experienced than I was. From there, I continued my education with self-taught HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and NodeJS. 

Over the years, I have gained experience in various areas, including software development and hardware repair. I have worked with several local tech companies, helping them with their software and hardware needs while also assisting customers with similar issues.

Some of my notable projects include developing a custom CMS for a local condo association, rebuilding the website for a local marble gallery called [Fine's Gallery](https://www.finesgallery.com), and currently working on a PHP-based framework for creating custom CMS.

In summary, I am a skilled software developer and sailor with a passion for learning and creating innovative solutions to problems.
